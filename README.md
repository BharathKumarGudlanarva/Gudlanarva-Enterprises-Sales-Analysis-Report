# Gudlanarva-Enterprises-Sales-Analysis-Report
I recently worked on building a Sales Analysis Report from scratch — starting with an Excel dataset and transforming it into a fully interactive dashboard that provides clear insights and helps in better decision-making.

Step 1: I created and organized the raw data in Excel.
Step 2: Imported the data into Power BI and applied data cleaning & transformation.
Step 3: Designed an interactive dashboard with multiple visuals to analyze sales from different perspectives.

My dashboard highlights:
✔️ Sales by Sub-Category – Understand which products drive the most revenue.
✔️ Sales by Segment & Region – Compare performance across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments, as well as different regions.
✔️ KPI Cards – Track total sales, profit, discount, and quantity at a glance.
✔️ Geographical Insights – A state-wise sales map to visualize market reach.
✔️ Trend Analysis – Sales over time to spot patterns and growth opportunities.

What excites me the most about this project is how Power BI transforms raw numbers into meaningful stories 📖 that business leaders can use for strategy and growth.

This project taught me the importance of combining data visualization with business logic to make insights actionable :)
